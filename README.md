# Engineers.SG Remake

[Engineers.SG](https://engineers.sg) is written in Ruby on Rails. However, it's a very old version and the data on the site has not changed in many years. I want to convert the site to a static website using a Static Site Generator. This is to save money.

You can follow along with the progress of the remake [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tpoebTT4fr7Vo8A0eCCjQtogiRSz-nAcBBXb_FvACu0/edit?usp=sharing).

This project was borne out of an appeal on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/miccheng_pair-programming-with-coderkungfu-michael-activity-7295086506996572162-fxDs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAfXjYBLd98h6A-Zm1jAyv7wMzgGQSdKHo) for people to pair with me on remaking Engineers.SG into a static site.
