    "description": "The group's aim is to enable people to create and deploy their own Deep Learning models built using TensorFlow. We will look at a combination of both beginner and intermediate models to learn key skills - as well as going to the next level with presentations about cutting edge papers and techniques. \r\n\r\nIdeally, each event will contain something for every level of experience - without having to explain neural networks 3-times over - and present models and code that you can play around with (this is made easier by adopting TensorFlow as the underlying framework). Essentially, we plan on simplifying Deep Learning into usable skills for the real world. \r\n\r\nLast, but not least, we're very proud to have the venue sponsored by TensorFlow's source : Google. Due to Google's venue security, we'll need to collect names in advance. But we don't need any more personal info, since we're not headhunters, nor spammers.",

I managed to exit my last business just before Lehman collapsed.  It took me years to find an idea I knew dead certain I could spend the next decade of my life building.\r\n\r\nThe idea came to me in summer 2014 whilst spending time in Silicon Valley, where I sensed an early movement to use distributed processing power to let anybody with access to a computer invest, borrow, contribute, shop, manufacture, vote, donate, spend and earn without the need for a central authority.\r\n\r\nIt was this promise of a decentralised financial infrastructure for the future that prompted me to incorporate Otonomos in early 2015 upon my return to Singapore, and start building a team around the idea who would bring the same passion and dedication to executing it.\r\n\r\nWhilst no doubt there will be countless obstacles on our journey, all of us here at Otonomos are carried by this ideal of building what we believe will result in a new vehicle for human ingenuity.\r\n\r\nI hope you’ll follow Otonomos on its journey.",
