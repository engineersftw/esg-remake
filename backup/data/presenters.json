She wrote the award-winning book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit in 2003 to explain how the lean principles from manufacturing offer a better approach to software development.\r\n\r\nOver the past several years, Mary has found retirement elusive as she lectures and teaches classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book,Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash in 2006, a third, Leading Lean Software Development: Results are Not the Point in 2009, and a fourth book, The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions in 2013. A popular writer and speaker, Mary continues to bring fresh perspectives to the world of software development.",

He was a recipient of the Singapore Millennium Foundation (SMF) Postdoctoral Research Scholarship in 2004 and the Lee Kuan Yew Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2006, which supported his post-doctoral research at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). His research interests include artificial/computational intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and data mining and analytics. Since 2006, he has developed an intense research interest in the field of computational finance, and to equip himself with the relevant financial knowledge, he has completed a Master of Science degree in Financial Engineering at the Risk Management Institute (RMI), National University of Singapore (NUS). He has worked on the modeling and forecasting of dynamic financial time-series data. The techniques developed have been applied to the construction of autonomous trading systems for the buying and selling of equities using the moving average and relative strength index technical trading rules, pricing of options on currency futures, financial volatility modeling and forecasting and the trading of straddle options, as well as the dynamic construction of efficient portfolios that seeks to maximize short term investment returns while minimizing the risk. In addition, reinforcement learning has been used for the optimization of trading rule parameters. Whye Loon is currently a Data Scientist at Nielsen Singapore, and he is also an Associate Faculty at the Singapore Institute of Management University (UniSIM), delivering two full courses in data analytics.

He has trained thousands of people in software development, Scrum, and modern agile practices for over a decade.\r\n\r\nHe is the author of Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS, Scaling Agile and Lean Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum and of Practices for Large-Scale Agile and Lean Development, all together with Craig Larman.\r\n\r\nBas works for Odd-e, a company which supports organization in improving their product development, mostly in Asia.\r\n\r\nBas currently lives in Singapore where he ended up after living in Holland (born), China and Finland. He worked in start-ups and in very traditional environments. This last uncomfortable experience convinced him that agile and lean development is a more human way of developing software products -- no matter how large your development is. \r\nHe had the opportunity to introduce Agile Development (particularly Scrum) in Nokia Networks (formally NSN) but had to move to Helsinki. There he watched dozens of product groups adopt scrum and other agile practices. The extreme cold in Finland forced him to migrate south and back to China where he focused on one large product group and its Scrum adoption. Bas is interested in Scrum with a special focus on large companies and large product development. But he also enjoyed working on technical practices, especially test-driven development (particularly in embedded environments) and continuous integration. He keeps working as a developer because he strongly believes you need a well-factored code base if you want to be fast and flexible. His hobbies are studies in lean production and quality management and, of course, programming.\r\n\r\nBas is also one of the authors of the CppUTest unit test framework for C/C++ and of Osaka a Mac UI automation framework written in Ruby.",
