The Magic Behind Engineers.SG - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Michael Cheng (@coderkungfu)

As the creator of Engineer.SG, I spent 1 year fine-tuning the techniques used in capturing and videographing conference and meetup talks. The system has now been replicated and taught to more than 40 volunteers.

I will now share how it is done with the GeekCamp.SG audience.

This talk was recorded at GeekCampSG 2016 on 29 September 2015.

An Unexpected Use for a Cardboard Box: Listening to the Moon - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Roland Turner

At last year's Geekcamp.SG I spoke about amateur satellite communication, my intention to build an automated tracker to simplify the process, and my longer term objective of communicating via the Moon. The tracker is now built and working but, in the best tradition of side-projects spawning their own side-projects, I have since realised that the tracker has direct application to Earth-Moon communication when combined with ...a cardboard box.

I am not making this up.

Come and hear how this insane experiment will work (or, if I am very lucky, did work).

Evolving Careers: How I Switched My Role from an Admin to a Javascript Developer - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Leticia Choo

I'm going to talk about how I started my job as an Admin and how I transitioned to a Javascript Developer working on SkylinkJS, a library built upon a new technology called WebRTC to enable video conferencing and IoT from your browsers to mobile phones, and to promote the usefulness of learning coding.

Create a 3D Game Engine for Pebble Smartwatch - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Shipeng Xu, PayPal

I find Pebble really awesome. But something is missing for Pebble.. 3D games! This talk will cover basic 3D rendering technics (like vertex shader, rasterization, etc) and apply them on Pebble watch!

Rust: Make System Programming Great Again! - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Omer Iqbal

Segfaults, Buffer Overflows, Data Races and Memory Leaks cross over unprotected memory with ease. They steal our jobs, crash our code, cause vulnerabilities in openssl. We need to be tough. The liberals from C and C++ have kept these borders open for too long. It's time to build a wall...

Rust is a systems programming language designed for speed, safety, concurrency and hype. It features a radical memory model that gives YOU control, rather than those pesky garbage collectors, while still maintaining compile time safety gurantees.

This talk will introduce Rust, focusing on the fabled memory model, the motivations behind its design and the consequences.

HyperLedger Project: Updates from the Blockchain - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Justin Lee

This is the 3rd installation of my talk on HyperLedger Project. There have been new developments, with Sawtooth Lake (from Intel) now publicly available, new protocols, chain code, and consensus models.

This technical talk will not only cover the concepts of Blockchain and the updates on the HyperLedger Project, but also show you how to set up and deploy Fabric and/or Sawtooth Lake, running your own Blockchain and start recording into your ledger.

GraphQL in an Age of REST - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Yos Riady

GraphQL is an application layer query language from Facebook. With GraphQL, you can define your backend as a well-defined graph-based schema. Then client applications can query your dataset as they are needed. GraphQL’s power comes from a simple idea — instead of defining the structure of responses on the server, the flexibility is given to the client. Will GraphQL do to REST what REST did to SOAP?

Kubernetes for Small Organisations: Is It Worth It? - GeekCampSG 2016,"Speaker: Ruiwen Chua

A common refrain is that ""big"" orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes may not be worth the effort to implement, particularly in small organisations that are resource-strapped. I'd like to share our experience at Lomotif in shifting our production architecture over to Kubernetes, the rationale for doing so, and naturally, the wins and frustrations we experienced along the way.

We'll also do a quick overview of Kubernetes and its major components and concepts.
